# Project BEES

**BEAM Elastic Execution Surface**

This file records the **intended scope** of Project BEES.

Project BEES is the **shim that lets BEAM languages** (Erlang, Elixir, Gleam, LFE) **be compiled to Silica and its constructs**. It is not a reproduction of the BEAM's code API for Silica programmers. Each BEAM language is compiled to Silica by its own language-to-Silica compiler. Those compilers are separate projects, and all of them target the BEES target contract. BEAM processes become plain Silica actors, BEAM atoms are Silica atoms held in Silica's atom table, and OTP's supervisors, gen_servers, and state machines become Silica's own constructs. BEES supplies the rest of what compiled BEAM code needs and Silica lacks: the term model, BIFs, ETS, timers, ports, and distribution. BEES does not duplicate every BEAM type or behaviour: its aim is to make compiling a BEAM language to Silica **possible, not easy**. It is built **in Silica** and is meant to **sit where a conventional BEAM would**, while adding **first-class support for running and balancing work across many cores** and **across a network**—so placement, migration, and integration with I/O and clustering are not afterthoughts.

The name nods to **Bogdan and Björn’s Erlang Abstract Machine (BEAM)**. BEES is not a reimplementation of OTP in full, many parts of which exist in native Silica including actors and supervisors; it is a **focused execution surface** and **shim** that carries that lineage forward in a new substrate.

## Scope (in)

- **Target contract** — the language-neutral specification that language-to-Silica compilers target. For each BEAM construct it says which Silica construct or BEES component it becomes. It comes with a conformance kit that compilers can check themselves against.
- **Execution surface** — the boundary at which “BEAM-like” code meets the host: schedulers, actor lifecycle hooks, links, and networking-aware execution (as the project defines them over time).
- **Multi-core** — **balancing and affinitizing actors** to cores, and policies for fairness, preemption, and locality, appropriate to a Silica-backed runtime. Silica schedules each core; BEES balances and places across cores through Silica's `migrate_actor()`. On OS-hosted apps it balances BEAM-style between the Silica runtime's carrier threads, and exclusive placement is never guaranteed, because the OS owns the cores. Running raw on a chip, it balances BEAM-style-ish directly onto the cores, and a pin is exclusive.
- **Networking** — **distribution-oriented paths**: naming or addressing actors across nodes, and protocols or adapters for sending messages and coordinating placement. There are two modes: **SEMP/TRUST**, secure by default, of which BEES is the first implementation, and **standard BEAM distribution**, an explicit downgrade for interoperating with Erlang/OTP clusters.
- **Clear dependency on Silica** — BEES is expected to use Silica for compilation and any runtime pieces that are already in Silica; **its repository** is meant to track the **orchestration layer, APIs, and integration** that are specific to a BEAM-style surface rather than the whole compiler.
- **Documentation of intent** — what is guaranteed, what is compatible with Erlang/OTP concepts, and what is **Silica-specific** behavior.

## Scope (out) — for now

- Claiming **bug-for-bug, wire-format, or full OTP compatibility** with any particular Erlang/BEAM release without explicit, tested guarantees.
- Loading or interpreting `.beam` bytecode at run time. BEAM-language code is compiled ahead of time.
- Duplicating every BEAM type and behaviour. Where Silica differs (for example, supervisor-only exit trapping, or Silica-shaped failure messages), the language compiler adapts.
- The language-to-Silica compilers themselves. Each one is its own project.
- Replacing the **entire** Silica project; BEES is a **sibling** product and repository whose role is the **actor execution and distribution** story on top of Silica.
- **Vendor-specific** deployment recipes unless they are clearly optional and documented as such.

(Adjust this section as the project ships concrete milestones.)

## Relationship to Silica

Silica provides the **language and toolchain** including actors and supervisors; Project BEES defines the **runtime-facing contract** and **infrastructure** for a BEAM-execution surface: scheduling, distribution hooks, and the glue between generated code and the machine. **Versioning** between Silica and BEES; The are no common version numbers between Silica and BEES. Each has its own release schedule.

## Status

Currently BEES is in its inception phase.

## Contributing & heritage

When describing BEES publicly, it helps to **credit the BEAM and its origins** in one line, for example: *inspired by Bogdan and Björn’s Erlang Abstract Machine and the Erlang/OTP community.*
