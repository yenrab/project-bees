md = f"""# BEES Dependency Graph

This is the [roadmap](roadmap.md) laid out as a graph, so that work can be handed to people or sub-agents
concurrently wherever nothing unmet stands in the way. It adds no decisions; where it disagrees with the roadmap,
the roadmap wins and this file is wrong. This file and [dependency-graph.yaml](dependency-graph.yaml) (the same
node list, for tooling) are generated by [gen-dependency-graph.py](gen-dependency-graph.py); edit the node list
there and re-run it.

## 1. How to read it

Every node is a piece of work with an ID from the roadmap: a spike (S1–S13), a Stage 0 deliverable (R0.x), a
stage or milestone (M0, M1, A1–A6, T1–T2, B1–B4), an integration point (I1–I3, X1–X2), a Track S item in the
Silica repository (S-n), or an external event (EXT, SEC).

Each node has three kinds of dependency:

- **Start after** (solid arrow). Hard. The node may not begin until every one of these is closed.
- **Closes only after** (dotted arrow). The node may begin, but cannot be called done until these have landed.
  Work on it proceeds on the interim the roadmap names.
- **Soft** (listed, not drawn). The node may start *and close* on the named interim; the dependency replaces the
  interim later without reopening the node.

**Rules for concurrent work:**

1. Any set of nodes whose *start after* lists are all closed may run at the same time.
2. Two concurrent nodes in the same `area` must have one owner, or agree on file ownership first. The areas are
   `contract/` (R0.3, T1, T2, S9, M1.T), `src/shim/` (M1.A, A1–A6), `src/inter_nodal/` (M1.B, M1.N, B1–B4),
   `native/` (S4, S12), `trials/` (the other spikes, S13) and `tools/` (R0.1).
3. **Track S nodes are in the Silica repository and follow Silica's `AI_POLICY.md`: human-vetted, no AI
   co-authors, smallest reasonable PRs.** A sub-agent may draft the proposal text and the failing trial in the
   BEES repository; a person files and lands the Silica change. Do not hand a Track S node to a sub-agent as
   implementation work.
4. A node is closed by trials, not by code that merely compiles (roadmap §5).
5. **S-5 is the critical path.** Whenever a choice exists, the work that shortens the path to S-5 landing (spike
   S8, then filing S-5, then offering to implement it) goes first.

## 2. Stage 0

Everything here can start now except R0.3 and M0. The thirteen spikes are independent of each other and of the
Silica prerequisites; the one soft edge is S13's exit measurement, which is better with S7's prototype.

```mermaid
graph LR
{decl(lambda n: n["id"] in s0ids)}
{stage0_edges()}
```

## 3. After Stage 0

Silica items are rounded; integration points are hexagons. Dotted arrows are *closes only after*. Soft
dependencies are not drawn; they are in the table. Stage 0 nodes appear here only where a later node depends on
them directly.

```mermaid
graph LR
{decl(lambda n: n["id"] in LATER_USED)}
{LATER_EDGES}
```

## 4. Waves

Nodes grouped by the earliest wave in which they may start: the wave after every *start after* dependency has
closed, where a node closes only once its *closes only after* dependencies have closed too (shown in brackets
where that is later than its start). A wave says only what *may* run together. Track S items run in the Silica
repository on Silica's schedule, so their wave is when they can be filed, and the waves after them assume they
land in time; if one slips, everything that closes after it slips with it.
